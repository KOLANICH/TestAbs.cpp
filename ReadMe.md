TestAbs - a test framework abstraction layer
============================================

Provides a very limited interface for the ones who want to reuse test frameworks machineries in own higher level testing solutions.

Testing frameworks all have own good and bad sides.

I.e.
* support of different output formats
* multithreading and multiprocessing

This library provides an interface to hide their diversity behind it.
